A great project idea related to Knowledge Base and Knowledge Engineering is to create a Propositional Logic Solver. This project involves building a system that can reason with a knowledge base made up of propositional logic statements. You can use various inference rules like Modus Ponens, And Elimination, Double Negation Elimination, etc., to query the knowledge base.

--------------------------

Project: Propositional Logic Solver

--------------------------

Project Overview

The Propositional Logic Solver will allow users to:

Input a set of propositional logic statements (knowledge base).
Query the knowledge base using specific propositions.
Apply inference rules to deduce the truth of propositions.
Visualize the logical deduction process.

Features
--------------------------
--------------------------

Knowledge Base Management+

Add, remove, or modify propositional statements.
Display the current state of the knowledge base.

--------------------------

Inference Engine+

Implement inference rules such as Modus Ponens, And Elimination, Double Negation Elimination, and others.
Check for logical consistency in the knowledge base.

--------------------------

Query System+

Allow users to query whether a certain proposition is true, false, or indeterminate based on the knowledge base.
Provide a step-by-step explanation of how the conclusion was reached using inference rules.

--------------------------

Visualization

Display the reasoning process in a readable format (e.g., proof trees or sequences of applied rules).

--------------------------

User Interface

Implement a simple command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based UI using Flask or Django.

--------------------------

Technologies

--------------------------

Programming Language: Python

--------------------------

Libraries:

SymPy for symbolic mathematics (if needed).
Flask or Django for a web interface.
PyDot for visualization (optional).
Standard Python libraries like itertools, re (for regular expressions), and collections.

Steps to Implement

--------------------------

Set Up the Project

--------------------------

Initialize a Git repository.
Create a virtual environment and install necessary dependencies.
--------------------------

Develop the Knowledge Base

Create classes or data structures to store and manage propositional statements.

--------------------------

Implement Inference Rules

Write functions for Modus Ponens, And Elimination, Double Negation Elimination, and other rules.

--------------------------

Build the Query System

Implement logic to query the knowledge base and apply inference rules to derive conclusions.

--------------------------

Create Tests

Write unit tests to ensure that the inference rules and querying system work correctly.

--------------------------

Optional: Develop a Web Interface

Use Flask or Django to create a web-based interface for the logic solver.

--------------------------

Document the Project

Write a README.md with instructions on how to use the project, and provide examples.

--------------------------

Upload to GitHub

Push the project to a GitHub repository.

--------------------------

Example Queries
"Is the proposition P ∧ Q true given the knowledge base?"
"What can be inferred if P → Q and P are true?"
"Is there a contradiction in the knowledge base?"
This project will demonstrate your understanding of knowledge representation, logic, and inference mechanisms, making it a strong addition to your GitHub portfolio.
