- self.mark_safe(cell)
- self.moves_made.add(cell)
- find neighbors cell and count with function
- Create an object with these values
- Append this sentences to knowledgebase
- Create a list of new inferences
- Check sentence in knowledgebase

- if any sentence of sentences is superset , 
find the difference between the two sets of cells
- If the mine count (count) is the same for both sentences, it means the additional cells in setDiff 
	must all be safe (because no extra mines are present). The AI then marks
	these cells as safe.
- If the difference in the number of cells (setDiff) equals the difference
	in the mine counts, it means the additional cells in setDiff must all be mines.
	The AI then marks these cells as mines.
- If neither of the above cases applies, it means that the difference in cells and 
counts can be used to create a new inference. This new inference is added to new_inferences.
- If the cells in the new sentence are a superset of those in the existing sentence, 
	we find the difference (setDiff) between the two sets of cells (now setDiff is the cells 
	that are in the new sentence but not in the existing sentence)
- If the mine counts are the same, it means the cells in setDiff are all safe.
- If the difference in the number of cells equals the difference in the mine counts, it means the cells in setDiff are all mines.
- If neither of the above cases applies, a new inference is created and added to new_inferences.
